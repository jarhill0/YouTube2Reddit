This folder contains configuration information as well as persistent data storage that the script checks each run. It should contain the following text files:

- `last_run.txt`: Epoch time (seconds since January 1, 1970). I recommend you populate it with [the current epoch time](http://www.epochconverter.com/clock). The file only needs to be initialized once, and afterwards it will be automatically updated upon successful completion of the script. The file is used to make sure that the bot only posts videos that are new since the time it last ran.
- `subbed_users.txt`: A list of Youtube usernames you wish to be "subscribed" to, one per line. **Note: These are usernames (like `CGPGrey`), not channel names (like `UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w`).**
- `subbed_channels.txt`: A list of Youtube channel names you wish to be "subscribed" to, one per line. Do not duplicate channels from `subbed_users.txt`. Both files exist because some channels do not have usernames, only cryptic channel names. **Note: These are channel names (like `UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w`), not usernames (like `CGPGrey`).**
- `target_sub.txt`: The name of the subreddit the script should submit to. I recommend that the account you run the script on should be an approved submitted or a moderator in whatever subreddit it submits to, because it will often submit several posts at once, which would be seen as spam in a subreddit where the account is not an approved submitter or a moderator.
